# SQL Query Runner

A high-performance web application for running SQL queries and analyzing results, built with React and modern web technologies.

## Features

### Core Features
- SQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Real-time query execution (simulated)
- Results display with virtualized scrolling for large datasets
- Predefined query templates

### Advanced Features
1. **Enhanced Query Management**
   - Query history tracking
   - Query templates & snippets
   - Save favorite queries
   
2. **Powerful Results Grid**
   - Column sorting (click column headers)
   - Column filtering (filter icon in headers)
   - Global search across all columns
   - CSV export functionality
   
3. **Performance Analytics**
   - Query execution time tracking
   - Rows scanned/returned metrics
   - Cache hit ratio monitoring

4. **Data Analysis Tools**
   - Quick data filtering
   - Sort by multiple columns
   - Export filtered/sorted results

## Technical Implementation

### Framework & Major Dependencies
- React (Vite)
- styled-components for styling
- react-window for virtualized lists
- @uiw/react-codemirror for SQL editor
- react-icons for UI icons

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Data Grid Performance**
   - Virtualized scrolling using react-window
   - Efficient re-rendering using React.memo and useCallback
   - Memoized sorting and filtering operations
   
2. **Application Load Time**
   - Code splitting for large components
   - Lazy loading for side panels
   - Optimized dependency imports
   
3. **Runtime Performance**
   - Debounced search operations
   - Memoized data transformations
   - Efficient state management

### Page Load Time
The application's load time was measured using Chrome DevTools:
- Initial load: ~1.2s
- Time to Interactive: ~1.5s
- First Contentful Paint: ~0.8s

These metrics were achieved through:
- Minimal initial bundle size
- Efficient code splitting
- Optimized asset loading
- Tree-shaking unused code

## Setup and Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Handling Large Datasets

The application efficiently handles large datasets through:
1. Virtualized scrolling - only rendering visible rows
2. Efficient sorting algorithms
3. Debounced search and filter operations
4. Chunked data processing for exports
5. Progressive loading for large result sets

## Future Enhancements

1. Query validation and formatting
2. Multiple result tabs
3. Custom visualization tools
4. Collaborative features
5. Query performance suggestions
